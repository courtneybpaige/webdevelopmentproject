        <ol>
            <li id="bff"><span class="underline">Bestfriends</span> (September 29, 2017 - January 11, 2019)
                <ul>
                    <li>We met when I moved to Arkansas right before my freshman year of highschool</li>
                    <li>He was 14 years old and I was 15, but we were in the same grade</li>
                    <li>I went to a party and he followed me around "like a puppy" (his words)</li>
                    <li>We became great friends and loved spending as much time together as possible</li>
                    <li>He was not a member of the church but loved the peace that was felt in our home compared to his</li>
                    <li>He became interested in what made our family so happy compared to than everyone else he knew</li>
                    <li>After about a year of being bestfriends, we both knew that we really cared about each other and wanted to become boyfriend and girlfriend</li>
                </ul>
            </li><br>
            <li id="dat"><span class="underline">Dating</span> (January 12, 2019 - April 21, 2021)
                <ul>
                    <li>He asked my dad permission to date me on January 12, 2024 and we became official</li>
                    <li>We were so in love and almost inseperable</li>
                    <li>Even when I got injured in sports, he did too (not purposefully), and we even received physical therapy treatment provided by our school together</li>
                    <li>The more time we spent together, the more he became interested in my family's faith and beliefs</li>
                    <li>Brayden attended early-morning seminary with me for a year</li>
                    <li>Brayden decided he wanted to take the missionary lessons</li>
                    <li>My mental health plumetted the second time I got injured and he loved and supported me through it all</li>
                    <li>My dad received a job offer in Dallas, Texas and my family was relocated there right before my Senior year</li>
                    <li>A month after moving, Brayden sent me a message letting me know that he had set a baptismal date with the missionaries</li>
                    <li>My family and I returned to Arkansas to be at Brayden's baptism</li>
                    <li>Brayden and I did all within our power to maintain our long-distance relationship</li>
                    <li>My mental health continued to decline</li>
                    <li>We both got accepted into BYU</li>
                    <li>I began to overthink our relationship and whether he was really going to be my future husband</li>
                </ul>
            </li><br>
            <li id="rab"><span class="underline">Relationship after Breakup</span> (April 22, 2021 - Present)
                <ul>
                    <li>I let him know that I felt like we needed to break up so that I could make sure that he really was the man I wanted to marry
                    <li>We discussed the importance of not losing our friendship</li>
                    <li>He respected my choice and continued to look for ways to show how much he loved me</li>
                    <li>We went to our freshman year at BYU</li>
                    <li>We still spent a lot of time together</li>
                    <li>I realized that I wasn't really going on dates with anyone else, like I had planned on doing when we broke up</li>
                    <li>We had a conversation about how I needed to branch out more - that was the last straw for him</li>
                    <li>To protect himself, he distanced himself from me</li>
                    <li>He began to spend all his time with his friends and I with mine</li>
                    <li>I missed my bestfriend and felt as though I had ruined our relationship forever</li>
                    <li>I felt more alone than I had ever felt up until that point in my life</li>
                    <li>We would see each other every once in a while but there was a noticable emotional barrier between us</li>
                    <li>I went on dates but no other relationship ever progressed or felt quite right</li>
                    <li>I decided to shift my focus to my relationship with my Heavenly Father</li>
                    <li>I got endowed and went to the temple weekly for peace of mind</li>
                    <li>I received my mission call - I was assigned to the Tijuana, Mexico mission</li>
                    <li>Brayden and I both realized that we wouldn't see each other for 2+ years and we tried our best to rebuild our friendship</li>
                    <li>After the semester ended, I returned to Texas and he returned to Arkansas</li>
                    <li>Brayden received his mission call - He was assigned to the San Pedro Sula West, Honduras mission</li>
                    <li>We facetimed almost daily, realizing we wished we had spent more time together while at BYU</li>
                    <li>He came to Texas for my farewell address and setting apart</li>
                    <li>I began my mission on May 16, 2022 and He began his on June 27, 2022</li>
                    <li>We emailed on pdays</li>
                    <li>About 7 months into my mission, I received an extremely stong impression that I needed to just focus on my mission</li>
                    <li>I talked with Brayden and he respected my decision to cut off communication and give my all to the mission</li>
                    <li>He continued emailing me every single week</li>
                    <li>After 11 months, I emailed him the first pday upon returning home and was so unbelievably happy</li>
                    <li>I remember telling my mom and sister that day, "I feel like myself again"</li>
                    <li>Ever since that day, we have emailed every pday</li>
                    <li>I continued dating other guys to make sure that he really was the man I wanted to marry</li>
                    <li>Every time a relationship has started to progress, I have felt God lead my heart away from the guy and towards Brayden</li>
                    <li>Through the whole dating process, my appreciation for Brayden and our relationship has skyrocketed.
                    <li>I have realized just how badly I want to marry Brayden</li>
                    <li>Brayden returns home from his mission June 6, 2024</li>
                    <li>I will be at the airport that day and at his homecoming address</li>
                    <li>He jokes that he is so thankful that I have "finally come to my senses"</li>
                    <li>I plan on marrying Brayden Dwayne Allen</li>
                </ul>
